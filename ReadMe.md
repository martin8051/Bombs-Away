## Bombs Away
---

### Game Description:
--- 
Bombs Away is a side scroller/left-right movement game. Player must avoid falling objects for given time 
period before moving to next level. There will be three levels, each varying in difficulty, controls 
available, and scene used, (third level will differ in format: explained below). Before each level will 
be a screen explaining the objective before throwing the user into the level. You might need to paste the files in
the folder labled "filesToCopy" into the folder bin/debug .

### How to play game:
---
Basic Left Right arrow keys movement. Player is given 5 lives and must survive for 60 seconds as bombs fall from the 
top of the screen. If a bomb collides with the player, they will lose a life. If all 5 lives are lost, the player 
is prompted with a screen to either retry or exit to the menu. If they survive, they will unlock the next level. In 
level three the player will shoot for a highscore by staying alive for as long as possible; the timer will start
at zero and increment unlike level one and two. The score is represented by the timer when player dies.
